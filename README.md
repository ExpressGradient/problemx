# **ProblemX**

ProblemX is a website for looking up the current problems that exist. For example, a user can look up for current problems on technology by visting the particular category and see the list of problems open/closed. The user can also see the organizations/companies/individuals working on particular problem and can collaborate with them upon the user likes. Apart from this, the org's To-do list for solving the problem is displayed public, the user can see the progress and finished tasks of the org.

So from all this data, a user can see what kind of problems in certain categories exist, what are the orgs working on those problems, what were the problems earlier and what did the org solve / create new problem etc.

This would be very beneficial for :

- People who're facing some problems and wants it to be solved (can post their problems here).
- Individuals who wants to collaborate with orgs, or start an own org on the problem the individual likes.
- Entreprenuers who have a difficulty finding problems or poor problem finding skills.

This website was created as a solution for HackNU 2.0.
